# node-red-obniz-neopixel-matrix-test #

just a few Node-RED flows to test a Neopixel matrix connected to an obniz board

This repository just contains a few simple [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) flows to control an [obniz board](https://obniz.com/products/obnizboard) with an attached Neopixel 16x16 RGB matrix - but they may easily be adapted to other geometries of chained WS2812 RGB LEDs (but only up to a length of 85 LEDs because of restrictions in the obniz board)

> Just a small note: if you like this work and plan to use it, consider "starring" this repository (you will find the "Star" button on the top right of this page), so that I know which of my repositories to take most care of.
